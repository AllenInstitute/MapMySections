## MapMySections general info

**Short name**: MapMySections Data Challenge 

**Tagline**: assign cell types to sparsely labeled fluorescent images

**Long name**: MapMySections Data Challenge: create a “MapMyCells”-like algorithm and user interface for matching fluorescent images of mouse genetic tools to corresponding cell types on the Allen Brain Cell Atlas

### Meta Description
When you see a tissue section and only a fraction of the cells are stained, how can you tell which kind of cells are represented? We are seeking tools that can accurately make this connection and relate it to existing knowledge of cell types on Allen Brain Map.

### Overview

When you see a tissue section and only a fraction of the cells are stained, how can you tell which kind of cells are represented? The Allen Institute faces this exact challenge when cataloging genetic tools as part of the [Genetic Tools Atlas](https://portal.brain-map.org/genetic-tools/genetic-tools-atlas). Current approaches involve qualitative comparison of the spatial location of targeted cells to that [of known cell types](https://knowledge.brain-map.org/abcatlas#AQIBSzlKTjIzUDI0S1FDR0s5VTc1QQACSFNZWlBaVzE2NjlVODIxQldZUAADAAQBAAKDgDx7g46YHgOEuBCEhSrCAwQyTlFUSUU3VEFNUDhQUUFITzRQAAWBr6ZKgemsDoGggUeAktXoBgAHAAAFAAYBAQJGUzAwRFhWMFQ5UjFYOUZKNFFFAAN%2BAAAABAAACFZGT0ZZUEZRR1JLVURRVVozRkYACUxWREJKQVc4Qkk1WVNTMVFVQkcACgALAVRMT0tXQ0w5NVJVMDNEOVBFVEcAAjczR1ZURFhERUdFMjdNMlhKTVQAAwEEAQACIzAwMDAwMAADyAEABQEBAiMwMDAwMDAAA8gBAAAAAUFQOEpOTjVMWUFCR1ZNR0tZMUIAAlExTkNXV1BHNkZaMEROSVhKQlEAAwAEAQECgazlhIG8aWIDhMwEVIT%2BMccABQAGAQECRlMwMERYVjBUOVIxWDlGSjRRRQADfgAAAAQAAAhHNEk0R0ZKWEpCOUFUWjNQVFgxAAlMVkRCSkFXOEJJNVlTUzFRVUJHAAoACwFub25lAAJub25lAAMBBAEAAiMwMDAwMDAAA8gBAAUBAQIjMDAwMDAwAAPIAQAAAAIDAA%3D%3D) and quantitative validation of cell types through follow-up single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic classification, and can be both costly and time consuming.  **For this data challenge, we are seeking usable tools that can accurately assign transcriptomic cell types to fluorescently labeled cells in serial two-photon tomography (STPT) images of adult mouse brain.**
