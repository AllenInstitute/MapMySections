# MapMySections
*GitHub starting page for the MapMySections data challenge*

Most folks would start [**on this page**](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/MapMySections/blob/main/_pages/challenge_page.markdown) (which is a stand in for the main event page that will be on alleninstitute.org).

They would then be directed to [**this data page on GitHub**](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/MapMySections/blob/main/_pages/overview.markdown) (which will eventually be replaced by a fancy GitHub website).
