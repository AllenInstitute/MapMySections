# MapMySections Data Challenge

#### When you see a tissue section and only a fraction of the cells are stained, how can you tell which kind of cells are represented? The MapMySections Data Challenge aims to address this question! Challenge details at https://alleninstitute.github.io/MapMySections

.

### Level of Support

This site will only be updated to correct errors and at the completion of the data challenge described on the main page (https://alleninstitute.github.io/MapMySections). We discourage contributions to the repo, but strongly encourage submissions to the MapMySections Data Challenge.
